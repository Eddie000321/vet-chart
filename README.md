## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
-   Docker Desktop (includes Docker Compose)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the VetChart EMR System up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eddie000321/vet-chart.git
    cd vet-chart
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend and Database:**

    Navigate to the `server` directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

    Start the database and backend services using Docker Compose. This will also build the backend Docker image.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Run Prisma migrations to set up your database schema:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

    Return to the project root directory:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**

    Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the full-stack application (frontend and backend):

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This command will concurrently start both the backend server (on `http://localhost:3001`) and the frontend development server (typically on `http://localhost:5173`).

Alternatively, you can run them separately:

**Run Backend Only:**

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Run Frontend Only:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

- Backend requires `JWT_SECRET` to start.
  - Local setup: add it to `server/.env`, for example `JWT_SECRET=dev-change-me`
  - Port: backend listens on `3001` by default; Dockerfile exposes `3001`.

#### Ports and proxy
- When running backend via Docker Compose, the container port `3001` is mapped to host `3002` (see `docker-compose.yml`).
- For frontend dev to point to the Docker backend, set `VITE_API_TARGET=http://localhost:3002` in the root `.env`.
- For local Node backend, use the default `VITE_API_TARGET=http://localhost:3001` (or omit to use default).

### Health & Metrics

- Health check: `GET http://localhost:3001/api/health`
- Prometheus metrics: `GET http://localhost:3001/metrics`

## 🖥️ Demo & Screenshots

Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the frontend development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). You should see the VetChart login page.

### Application Flow
1. **Authentication**: Secure login with role-based dashboard access
2. **Dashboard**: Overview of daily appointments, patient statistics, and quick actions
3. **Patient Management**: Add/edit patient profiles with comprehensive medical history
4. **Appointment Scheduling**: Calendar-based booking with conflict detection
5. **Medical Records**: Create detailed treatment records with PDF export capability
6. **Billing System**: Generate invoices with customizable item templates
7. **Analytics**: Track clinic performance with revenue and appointment metrics

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Admin**: Full system access including analytics and user management
- **Veterinarian**: Patient records, appointments, and medical documentation
- **Staff**: Appointment scheduling, billing, and basic patient information
